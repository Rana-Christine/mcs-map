# Description

This is a map displaying providers information of MCS(https://mcs.com.pr/en/Pages/home.aspx) with Category = General Medicine, Specialty = General Medicine and Location = San Juan.

## Usage

To run this example, you need a [Mapbox token](http://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/docs/get-started/mapbox-tokens). You can either set it as `MAPBOX_TOKEN` in `src/app.js`, or set a `MapboxAccessToken` environment variable in the command line.

Alternative to acquiring a Mapbox token, you can install `maplibre-gl` and change all `import from 'react-map-gl'` to `import from 'react-map-gl/maplibre'`. You also need to supply a third-party or self-hosted `mapStyle` URL.

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```
